# Project and Practical

## REST APIs URL (Render Web Service)
You can access the deployed REST APIs on Render using the following URL:
- [Your choice REST API](<https://your-choice-rest-api.onrender.com>)
- [OpenTDB REST API](<REPLACE WITH A LINK TO YOUR REST API>)

## Setup Environment

Follow these steps to set up the project after cloning the repository:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <REPLACE WITH A LINK TO YOUR GITHUB REPO.git>
cd <REPLACE WITH YOUR GITHUB REPO NAME>
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file and filling in the required configurations:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=

ADD OTHER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
```

## Running REST APIs Locally

To run the REST APIs on your local machine, run the following command:

```bash
<ADD THE COMMAND HERE>
```

Your local API should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>.
